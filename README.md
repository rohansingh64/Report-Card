# Report-Card

This C++ program is a simple Student Management System that allows adding, searching, and updating student records. Students' data (name, roll number, CGPA) is stored in a text file. The system interacts with the user through a console interface, updating the file as needed. Key operations include:

1. **Adding a Student:** Prompts for student details and appends them to a file.
2. **Searching for a Student:** Looks up student records by name and displays matching entries.
3. **Updating a Student's CGPA:** Finds a student by roll number and updates their CGPA.

The program uses file handling for data persistence and includes basic error handling for file operations.
